You are in charge of a team of <b>N</b> other people.
Together, you are going to prepare decorations for a huge party.
In order to do that, each of you needs to have a pair of scissors.
You already have one, but none of your helpers do.
</p>
<p>
You have recently purchased <b>N</b> pairs of scissors from an online retailer.
They just arrived, but there is a small issue: each pair of scissors is wrapped in plastic.
Getting scissors out of the plastic wrap requires having another pair of scissors (that's not in plastic) and it takes 10 seconds.
</p>
<p>
Assume that everything other than opening the packages happens instantly.
(I.e., whenever a new pair of scissors has been opened, somebody can take it and immediately start opening another box.)
</p>
<p>
Calculate and return the shortest amount of time (in seconds) in which it is possible to release all the scissors from their plastic wraps.
