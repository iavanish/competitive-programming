 * Testcase Example:  '[100,200,150,1000]'
 *
 * You have some apples, where arr[i] is the weight of the i-th apple.Â  You
 * also have a basket that can carry up to 5000 units of weight.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of apples you can put in the basket.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: arr = [100,200,150,1000]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: All 4 apples can be carried by the basket since their sum of
 * weights is 1450.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: arr = [900,950,800,1000,700,800]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The sum of weights of the 6 apples exceeds 5000 so we choose
 * any 5 of them.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= arr.length <= 10^3
 * 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^3
 *
